# guessTheNumber
A simple guess the number game i wrote as hands on from my learning of Android Development. Getting myself comfortable with layouts, views, intents, event listeners and more. 
I plan to improve it along with better and minimal Ui as i learn more about material design and different layouts in Android. 
This is an early stage push. Still have some fixes to be done.
